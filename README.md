# MIT Reality Hack: Team 35

## Philosophy
Mobile devices changed everything - to be able to carry our computers everywhere we go was truly revolutionary. The question we ask today is: 

- Can we get AR environments to people *everywhere they go? Safely*? 
- Can we bring these experiences **outside** our living rooms or outside curated events and schools? 
- Can we do to AR what *laptops did to computers?*
- Can we do to AR what responsive design did to websites? 

With a *billion different surface dimensions* - **how do we use the grid in graphic design to make responsive AR posters optimized for a positive experience in each setting?**

Dimension is just one part, then there are the needs in public and private spaces, lighting, and the visual clutter of the environment - factors that will all dictate the quality of the experience. How do we account for all these considerations in the future? 

What would need to add to the toolkit of graphic design for better communication in a new media: 

- dynamic spatial layout changes 
- physics or the lack of physics
- music
- user-defined experience
- etc. 

## TypeHall
Picture yourself walking through the park when you see a flier of your favorite band - The Sanders. What if your AR device was capable of *understanding its surroundings and repositioning the poster in the three-dimensional world.*

What was originally a common street flier has transfigured into an **interactive typographic sculpture, a musical instrument, and an audiovisual piece of art** that enables more meaningful interactions.

 Nobody's looking - you pull the poster off the wall, roll it up under your arm and go home. You’re not broke but your living room is smaller than the park you saw this at. The poster repositions itself in your living room so that you get the best possible interaction/layout. The next day you take it to school to show it to your friend; all you’ve got today is the cafeteria table. The poster would then rearrange itself into yet another layout optimized again, to give you the best possible interactive experience - the same shapes are now spinning on your circular table and you can play pieces of your own version of the Sanders’ song ‘The FiliBer'.
